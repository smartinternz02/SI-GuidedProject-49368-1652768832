SMS Spam Detection using IBM Watson

SMS (Short Message Service) is a standard of mobile protocols which allows users to communicate without connecting to the internet. Due to the cheap cost of SMS services in most telecommunications service providers, and its accessibility and efficiency compared to email services, it is one of the most common communication tools worldwide. However, the attention focused on this service attracts criminals to use it as a means for performing malicious activities and has created trouble for customers and service providers. 

An SMS spam message is an unwanted or unsolicited text message which is sent to the user's mobile phone with various content types, such as advertisements, awards, free services and promotions. The main goal of spammers is to steal critical user information such as username, password, and credit card details. 

Therefore, in this project, we proposed an Artificial Intelligence method for detection of SMS spam messages. The proposed model contains two main stages: feature extraction and decision making. In the first stage, we have extracted relevant features from the dataset based on the characteristics of spam and legitimate messages to reduce the complexity and improve performance of the model. Then, an averaged neural network model was applied on extracted features to classify messages into either spam or legitimate classes. The method is evaluated in terms of accuracy and F-measure metrics on a realworld SMS dataset with over 5171 messages.

We used various algorithms such as Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine-sigmoid, Support Vector Machine-rbf and Decision tree and found that Multinomial Native Bayes gives the highest accuracy of 96.81 %.
